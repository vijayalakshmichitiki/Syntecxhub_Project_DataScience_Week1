# NumPy Data Explorer

## Objective
To understand and apply NumPy fundamentals such as array creation, indexing,
slicing, mathematical operations, reshaping, broadcasting, and performance
comparison with Python lists.

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy

## Tasks Performed
- Created 1D and 2D NumPy arrays
- Performed indexing and slicing
- Applied mathematical and statistical operations
- Used axis-wise operations
- Implemented reshaping and broadcasting
- Saved and loaded NumPy arrays
- Compared execution speed of NumPy arrays vs Python lists

## Outcome
This project demonstrates efficient numerical computation using NumPy and
highlights its performance advantages over traditional Python lists.
